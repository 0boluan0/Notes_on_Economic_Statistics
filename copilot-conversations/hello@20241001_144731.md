**user**: hello
[Timestamp: 2024/10/01 14:47:31]

**ai**: OK Feel free to ask me questions about [[New Chat]]. 

Please note that this is a retrieval-based QA for notes longer than the model context window. Specific questions are encouraged. For generic questions like 'give me a summary', 'brainstorm based on the content', Chat mode with *Send Note to Prompt* button used with a *long context model* is a more suitable choice.
